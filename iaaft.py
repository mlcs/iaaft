iaaft - Iterative amplitude adjusted Fourier transform surrogates

        This module implements the IAAFT method [1] to generate time series
        surrogates (i.e. randomized copies of the original time series) which
        ensures that each randomised copy preserves the power spectrum of the
        original time series.

def surrogates(x, ns, tol_pc=5., verbose=True, maxiter=1E6, sorttype="quicksort"):
    """
    Returns iAAFT surrogates of given time series.

    Parameter
    ---------
    x : numpy.ndarray, with shape (N,)
        Input time series for which IAAFT surrogates are to be estimated.
    ns : int
        Number of surrogates to be generated.
    tol_pc : float
        Tolerance (in percent) level which decides the extent to which the
        difference in the power spectrum of the surrogates to the original
        power spectrum is allowed (default = 5).
    verbose : bool
        Show progress bar (default = `True`).
    maxiter : int
        Maximum number of iterations before which the algorithm should
        converge. If the algorithm does not converge until this iteration
        number is reached, the while loop breaks.
    sorttype : string
        Type of sorting algorithm to be used when the amplitudes of the newly
        generated surrogate are to be adjusted to the original data. This
        argument is passed on to `numpy.argsort`. Options include: 'quicksort',
        'mergesort', 'heapsort', 'stable'. See `numpy.argsort` for further
        information. Note that although quick sort can be a bit faster than 
        merge sort or heap sort, it can, depending on the data, have worse case
        spends that are much slower.

    Returns
    -------
    xs : numpy.ndarray, with shape (ns, N)
        Array containing the IAAFT surrogates of `x` such that each row of `xs`
        is an individual surrogate time series.
